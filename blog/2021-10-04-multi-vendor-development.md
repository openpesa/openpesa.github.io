Hello 👋,

I hope all is well where ever you are. Today I want to announce we have started and resuming the development of multi-vendor support in the Openpesa packages.

Starting with Pesa SDK for PHP

Current efforts are directed towards supporting customer-to-business (C2B) single payment via Tigo Pesa and Airtel Money.

Currently, we only have SDK for PHP we are looking forward to supporting Javascript next.
Please find some documentation for the SDK, not much but its start, link at the bottom

If you have any question or inquiry, am available and happy to help.

All developments are opensource find dev branch at https://github.com/openpesa/php-pesa/tree/develop

More testing is required, check and try the examples, feedback is highly appreciated,

-Alpha
